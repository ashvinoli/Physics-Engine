# Physics-Engine
A tiny engine to see how charges and mass points i.e (electric and gravitational) forces act on a system of point masses.
## Usage
Open up processing and tweak the parameters IN THE CODE like mass, charge, initial position, velocity, number of particles to see how the system would behave. You have to tweak params in "masses" class and change number of particles in the "Engine" file.
